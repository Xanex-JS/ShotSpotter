# Installation

Drag and drop ``ShotSpotter`` into your resource folder.

Add ``ensure ShotSpotter`` into your server.cfg or resources.cfg

# Important

You will need a duty system to detect if a cop is on-duty or not.

Feel Free to download my duty script for QTARGET (Permissions has been given to re-upload by the development team at QTARGET.)

# Information

This script now supports Blips

Support for SnailyCADV4's API by [@Casper](https://github.com/Dev-CasperTheGhost) Will be implemented soon!
